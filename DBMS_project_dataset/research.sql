First, we measure the subtle movements of the soft tissues of the eye region using a monocular RGB-D camera setup, and second, we model and animate these movements using parameterized motion models. The muscles and skin of the eye region are very thin and sheetlike. By representing these tissues as thin elastic sheets in reduced coordinates, we have shown how we can measure and animate these tissues efficiently. To measure tissue movements, we optically track both eye and skin motions using monocular video sequences. The key idea here is to use a reduced coordinates framework to model thin sheet-like facial skin of the eye region. This framework implicitly constrains skin to conform to the shape of the underlying object when it slides. The skin configuration can then be efficiently reconstructed in 3D by tracking two dimensional skin features in video. This reduced coordinates model allows interactive real-time animation of the eye region in WebGL enabled devices using a small number of animation parameters, including gaze. Additionally, we have shown that the same reduced coordinates framework can also be used for physics-based simulation of the facial tissue movements and to produce tissue deformations that occur in facial expressions.

We then develop a trajectory-based gradient algorithm to minimize the smooth truncated estimation of the risk-sensitive cost and derive conditions under which a sequence of truncations can be used to solve the original, untruncated cost problem.', '0', 'N/G', 'arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.04157', 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=YwT89XIAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=YwT89XIAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC', 0),

In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining regret guarantees for MAB problems in which the rewards of each arm form a Markov chain which may not belong to a single parameter exponential family. To achieve logarithmic regret in such problems is not difficult: a variation of standard Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) does the job. However, the constants obtained from such an analysis are poor for the following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to design an algorithm that works well independent of whether the underlying model is truly Markovian or i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm that identifies whether the rewards from each arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total variation distance-based test.

Numerous scientific studies also report increases in the intensity, duration, and spatial extents of floods, higher atmospheric temperatures, warmer sea, changes in precipitation patterns, and changing groundwater levels. This work briefly discusses about the present scenario regarding impact of climate change on water resources in India. Due to the insufficient resolution of climate models and their generally crude representation of sub-grid scale and convective processes, little confidence can be placed in any definite predictions of such effects, although a tendency for more heavy rainfall events seems likely, and a modest increase in frequency in floods.

Here the objective is to track the movement of the hand irrespective of the shape, size, and color of the hand. And, for this, a motion template guided by optical flow (OFMT) is proposed.

Colonoscopy images usually consist of nonrigid objects such as a polyp, and no approaches have been proposed to recovery shape and absolute size from a single image. Hence, it is a challenging topic to reconstruct polyp shape using computer vision technique. This paper proposes a polyp shape retrieval method based on Shape from Shading (SFS), and this research contributes to mitigating constraint for applying SFS to the single colonoscopy image using vascular border information. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method recovered approximate polyp shapes.', '0', 'N/G', 'BIOIMAGING', 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=o4yGgBQAAAAJ&cstart=100&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=o4yGgBQAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC', 0),

Our method can optimally select wavelet subbands for any combination of sampling frequencies of the signal and number of decomposition levels. Based on proposed CoG criterion, the signal is reconstructed from a number of selected subbands, and instantaneous Hilbert envelope is constructed for localizing peaks of the signal. Finally, a simple decision rule is applied to annotate S1 and S2 sounds of the PCG signal.

Several recent works have shown the synthesis of highly photo-realistic videos of talking faces, but they either require a source video to drive the target face or only generate videos with a fixed head pose. This lack of facial movement is because most of these works focus on the lip movement in sync with the audio while assuming the remaining facial keypoints\' fixed nature. To address this, a unique audio-keypoint dataset of over 150,000 videos at 224p and 25fps is introduced that relates the facial keypoint movement for the given audio. This dataset is then further used to train the model, Audio2Keypoint, a novel approach for synthesizing facial keypoint movement to go with the audio. Given a single image of the target person and an audio sequence (in any language), Audio2Keypoint generates a plausible keypoint movement sequence in sync with the input audio, conditioned on the input image to preserve the target person\'s facial characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an audio-keypoint dataset and learns a model to output the plausible keypoint sequence to go with audio of any arbitrary length. Audio2Keypoint generalizes across unseen people with a different facial structure allowing us to generate the sequence with the voice from any source or even synthetic voices.

Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the model control variable which includes model parameters, initial and boundary conditions, propagates through the model, resulting in the degradation of streamflow forecast. Various studies in the past have shown the potential of soil moisture assimilation in hydrological models resulting in the improved forecast. Further, the efficiency of assimilation is based on the number and the distribution of observations used. This study proposes a new approach called Forward sensitivity method (FSM), which operates in two phases. By running the model and forecast sensitivity dynamics forward in time, the first phase places the observations at or near where the square of the forecast sensitivity with respect to the control takes maximum values. Then using only this subset of observations, the second phase estimates the unknown elements of the control by solving a resulting weighted least squares problem. The power of this approach is demonstrated by assimilating ASCAT soil moisture observations into a conceptual Two Parameter Model in a medium sized watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. The model run extends for four monsoon years from June 2007 to June 2011 and two assimilation scenarios were tested.

This problem is examined by using Saltzman’s spectral model of convection that admits both chaotic and nonchaotic regimes and is controlled by two parameters—Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. The problem is simplified by stripping the seven-variable constraint to a three-variable constraint. Since emphasis is placed on observation positioning to avoid cost-function flatness, forecast sensitivity to controls is needed. Four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is silent on this issue of observation placement while Forecast Sensitivity Method (FSM) delivers sensitivities used in placement. With knowledge of the temporal forecast sensitivity matrix V, derivatives of the forecast variables to controls, the cost function can be expressed as a function of the observability Gramian VTV using first-order Taylor series expansion. The goal is to locate observations at places that force the Gramian positive definite. Further, locations are chosen such that the condition number of VTV is small and this guarantees convexity in the vicinity of the cost function minimum. Four numerical experiments are executed, and results are compared with the structure of the cost function independently determined though arduous computation over a wide range of the two nondimensional numbers.

Data assimilation experiments in the identical-twin mode determine the best place to make observations that minimize the forecast error through adjustment of model controls. The emphasized controls are those associated with the fluxes of heat and moisture from sea to atmosphere. Results indicate that the best observations are at that time and place when the outflowing continental air passes over the warmest sea surface temperatures. In the case studied, this warmest zone is directly over the Loop Current. Observations at times long after the modified air leaves these warmest waters lead to relatively poor control adjustments and little improvement in the forecast. If input to data assimilation is restricted to observations of a single model variable over short intervals of time (the order of several hours), results are relatively poor. Yet, a significant improvement is forthcoming if one of the observations is replaced by an observation from another model variable.

In this setting, the Federated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining -approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent (FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server can use to approximate clients\' gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter, -H\\\"older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle complexity of FedLRGD scales like and that of FedAve scales like (neglecting sub-dominant factors), where is a \"communication-to-computation ratio,\" is the parameter dimension, and is the data dimension.

Learning network behavior from observational data is complicated due to the bias introduced by the protocols used during data collection. CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming from an RCT. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic datasets and two use cases, including more than nine months of real data from the Puffer video streaming system, shows that it provides accurate counterfactual predictions, reducing prediction error by 44% and 53% on average compared to expert-designed and standard supervised learning baselines.', '0', 'N/G', 'arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.01811', 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=3qPiYJoAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=3qPiYJoAAAAJ:hvmnpdAuIbkC', 0),

The model fits the data well both in and out of sample across the 50 states of the United States, with comparable scores to state of the art ensemble predictions. In contrast to recent models of epidemics, rather than assuming that individuals directly control the contact rate which governs the spread of disease, we assume that individuals control the rate at which they vary their number of interactions, ie they control the derivative of the contact rate. We propose an implicit feedback law for this control input and verify that it correlates with policies taken throughout the pandemic.

For example, in the context of movie recommender systems -- a canonical application for matrix completion -- a user who vehemently dislikes horror films is unlikely to ever watch horror films.

Adaptive control is a flexible countercyclical policy approach, whereby different areas release from lockdown in potentially different gradual ways, dependent on the local progression of the dis-ease. Because of these features, adaptive control requires the ability to decrease or increase social distancing in response to observed and projected dynamics of the disease outbreak. We show via simulation of a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and of a synthetic intervention (SI) model that adaptive control performs at least as well as immediate and full release from lockdown starting May 4 and as full release from lockdown after a month (ie, after May 31). The key insight is that adaptive response provides the option to increase or decrease socioeconomic activity depending on how it affects disease progression and this freedom allows it to do at least as well as most other policy alternatives.

That is, we need a new notion of performance metric.

As a proof of concept, we propose an RL policy using Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle and argue that it satisfies the stability property as long as the system dynamics under the optimal policy respects a Lyapunov function. The assumption of existence of a Lyapunov function is not restrictive as it is equivalent to the positive recurrence or stability property of any Markov chain, i.e., if there is any policy that can stabilize the system then it must possess a Lyapunov function. And, our policy does not utilize the knowledge of the specific Lyapunov function.

For this setup, we propose an algorithm that utilizes matrix estimation on the corrupted data as a key subroutine, and then performs ordinary least squares regression with the de-noised covariates. If we instantiate the matrix estimation subroutine with hard singular value thresholding (HSVT), then our results indicate that as long as the number of samples scales as ρ− 4r log5 (p), then our in-and out-ofsample prediction error decays to 0 as p→∞; here, ρ represents the fraction of observed (noisy) covariates, r is the (approximate) rank of the true covariate matrix, and p denotes the ambient dimension (number of predictors). As an important byproduct of our approach, we demonstrate that HSVT with regression acts as a form of implicit ℓ0-regularization since HSVT aims to find a lowrank structure within the covariance matrix. Thus, we can view the sparsity of the regression vector as a consequence of the covariate structure rather than a model assumption as is often considered in the literature. Moreover, under HSVT, our finite sample bounds match (up to log4 (p) factors) the best guaranteed sample complexity results in the literature for algorithms that require precise knowledge of the underlying model; we highlight that our approach, in contrast, is model agnostic.

Then to achieve vanishing prediction error, the number of required samples scales faster than pσ2, where σ2 is a bound on the noise variance. In a high-dimensional setting where p is large but the covariates admit a low-dimensional representation (say r≪ p), then Principal Component Regression (PCR), cf.[36], is an effective approach; here, the response variables are regressed with respect to the principal components of the covariates. The resulting number of required samples to achieve vanishing prediction error now scales faster than rσ2 (≪ pσ2). Despite the tremendous utility of PCR, its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed (discrete and continuous) valued covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge, cf.[24]. As the main contribution of this work, we address this challenge by rigorously establishing that PCR is robust to noisy, sparse, and possibly mixed valued covariates. Specifically, under PCR, vanishing prediction error is achieved with the number of samples scaling as r max (σ2, ρ− 4 log5 (p)), where ρ denotes the fraction of observed (noisy) covariates. We establish generalization error bounds on the performance of PCR, which provides a systematic approach in selecting the correct number of components r in a data-driven manner.

The recognition task is generally challenging since Assamese handwriting is mixed with the discrete and cursive writing style, and further complicated due to the placing of vowel/consonant modifier above and/or below already written character in delayed order. Also, as it contains large character set, there is lack of common definition of the basic unit (BU) for automatic recognition. As a step in this direction, first, we select 173 BU capable of characterizing 20K most frequent Assamese words. The HMMs are created for these selected BUs. Next, we create a lexicon for word recognition where each word is represented by all probable \"sequence of BUs\" that constitute the word.

We make contributions with regards to (i) the encoding of features used and (ii) the matching strategy. Most works in the literature that consider comparing the temporal sequence between two signatures utilize the local features derived at each sample point of the online trace. One aspect worth investigating is on representing these features in a probabilistic framework. In this work, we use the parameters from a pre-learnt Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to encode the features. Secondly, with regards to matching strategy, we consider comparing a histogram between a test signature with those obtained from the enrolled signatures of a user. The histogram is generated from the GMM encoded features by partitioning the online trace of the signature into a number of segments.
